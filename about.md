# About the Project

The **SIDEMIX** project focuses on improving understanding of soil stiffness degradation and micromechanical behavior of sandâ€“fine mixtures under cyclic loading.  
Our research integrates experimental and numerical methods, including:
- Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
- Triaxial and torsional cyclic testing
- Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations
